# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
- [[OOP is a programming paradigm]] that focuses on objects and their interactions.
- It provides a way to structure code and organize data more effectively.

## Classes and Objects
- [[In OOP, a class]] is a blueprint for creating objects.
- An object is an instance of a class.

## Encapsulation
- [[Encapsulation is the practice]] of hiding internal details and providing a public interface.
- It helps in achieving data abstraction and code modularity.

## Inheritance
- [[Inheritance is a mechanism]] where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another class.
- It allows code reuse and supports the concept of hierarchical relationships.

## Polymorphism
- [[Polymorphism allows objects of different classes]] to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- It enables flexibility and extensibility in code design.
