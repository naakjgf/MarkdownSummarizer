# Git Basics
- [[Git is a distributed version control system]] used for tracking changes in software development projects.
- It allows collaboration, code management, and version tracking.

## Repository
- [[A repository is a central location]] where Git stores all project files and version history.
- It includes branches, commits, and other Git objects.

## Commit
- [[A commit represents a specific version]] of the project at a given point in time.
- It captures changes made to files and includes a commit message for documentation.

## Branching
- [[Branching allows creating independent lines of development]] in Git.
- It enables working on different features or bug fixes simultaneously.

## Merge
- [[Merging combines changes]] from different branches into a single branch.
- It allows incorporating code changes and resolving conflicts.

## Remote Repository
- [[A remote repository is a shared repository]] that can be accessed by multiple developers.
