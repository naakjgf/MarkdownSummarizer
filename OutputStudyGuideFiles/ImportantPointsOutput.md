# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- Data types of the reference and array need to match.

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- Gotcha: Array size     is not modifiable once instantiated. 

# Cybersecurity
- **cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks

## Types of Cybersecurity Threats
- Malware is any file or program used to harm a computer user, such as worms, computer viruses, Trojan horses and spyware

## Cybersecurity Strategies
- The people using these systems play a key role in maintaining their safety

# Databases
- **database** is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically

### SQL
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with a database
- Fascinating point: SQL is also an ANSI and ISO standard.

### NoSQL
- NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables
- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable and highly functional

# JavaScript Fundamentals
- **JavaScript** is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities

## Variables in JavaScript
- General form: var variableName = value;
- Variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9).

## Arrays in JavaScript
- General form:  var arrayName = [item1, item2, ...];
- Keep in mind: The length of a JavaScript array can be changed at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array.

# Machine Learning
- **Machine Learning** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

## Supervised Learning
- Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known.
- The algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.

## Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised learning is used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.
- Keep in mind: Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).

# Python Basics
- **Python** is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## Variables and Data Types
- General form: variable_name = value
- The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.

## Lists in Python
- General form: list_name = [item1, item2, ...
- Note: List index starts at 0 and goes up to n-1, where n is the number of items in the list.

# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);
