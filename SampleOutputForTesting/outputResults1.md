# Vectors

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);

- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;

- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not  modifiable once instantiated.
