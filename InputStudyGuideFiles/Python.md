# Python Basics
- [[**Python** is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.]]
- Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.

## Variables and Data Types
- [[General form: variable_name = value]]
- ex: my_variable = 10;

- Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.
- [[The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.]]
    - [[What happens when a value is assigned to a Python variable?:::The variable is automatically declared and memory space is reserved.]]

## Lists in Python
- [[General form: list_name = [item1, item2, ...]]]
- ex: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4];

- Lists in Python are similar to arrays in other languages but with added functionality.
- [[should the items in a Python list all be of the same data type?:::No, Python lists can contain items of different data types.]]
- [[Note: List index
- starts at 0 and goes up to n-1, where n is the number of items in the list.]]
