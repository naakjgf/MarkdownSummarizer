# Databases
- In computer science, a [[**database** is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically]].
- Databases help in storing and handling data efficiently.

### SQL
- [[SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with a database]]. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, etc.
- SQL commands can be divided into several types, among which the Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL).

- SQL helps in performing all types of data operations in RDBMS.
- You might wonder, [[Why is SQL important?:::SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is used for managing and organizing data in all sorts of systems in which various data relationships exist.]]
- [[Fascinating point: SQL
- is also an ANSI and ISO standard.]]

### NoSQL
- [[NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables]].
- NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

- [[NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable and highly functional]]
- An interesting question is, [[Can NoSQL replace SQL?:::NoSQL databases are not a replacement for SQL databases. They are an alternative. Certain data sets work better under a NoSQL database than in a SQL database and vice versa.]]
