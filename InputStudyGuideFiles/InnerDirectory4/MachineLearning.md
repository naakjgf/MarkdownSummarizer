# Machine Learning
- [[**Machine Learning** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.]]
- It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions.

## Supervised Learning
- [[Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known.]]
- ex: Predicting house prices from features of the house like size, location, etc.

- The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs.
- [[The algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.]]
    - [    [      [Why [[Why does the algorithm compare its output with the correct outputs?:::
    - To adjust the model accordingly and minimize the error.]]

## Unsupervised Learning
- [[Unsupervised learning is used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.]]
- ex: Identifying customer segments in the data.

- Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data.
- [[Does unsupervised learning need labeled data?:::No, unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.]]
- [[Keep in mind: Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data)
- or a means towards an end (feature learning).]]
